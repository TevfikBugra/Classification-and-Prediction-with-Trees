# Classification-and-Prediction-with-Trees
Classifying and predicting the type of messages as either spam or nonspam, and predicting the price attribute of "Toyota Corolla".

**Objective**: This project focuses on classifying messages as either spam or non-spam and predicting the price of a Toyota Corolla. The goal is to employ tree-based methods to achieve accurate predictions and classifications.

### Methodology:

**Data Partitioning**: Split data into training and test sets to ensure robust evaluation of model performance.
**Tree-Based Methods**: Utilize decision tree (rpart) and random forest algorithms for classification and regression tasks.
**Parameter Optimization**: Perform extensive parameter tuning to enhance model accuracy and minimize prediction errors.
**Programming Language**: R

**Summary**: This project demonstrates advanced proficiency in R, including data manipulation, statistical modeling, and machine learning. By leveraging decision trees and random forests, we analyze datasets to classify messages and predict car prices effectively. Our approach highlights a strong grasp of data mining principles and predictive modeling techniques, emphasizing our ability to optimize model performance through parameter tuning.
